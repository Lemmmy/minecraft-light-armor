# Solarflame's light armor
A resource pack made by me inspired by [Dresdom](https://www.reddit.com/user/Dresdom/)'s [light armor pack](https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/7e8zqv/i_made_a_light_armor_resource_pack/), using the original Minecraft textures as a base.

This pack aims to fix the problem where the default armor textures almost completely cover player skins, which is quite unpleasant when playing multiplayer. 

Chainmail armor is unchanged as its already see-through and leather armor is unchanged because a lot of multiplayer minigames use it for purposes like distinguishing different teams.

Both Dresdom's original pack and my remake with modern textures are available in this repository.

The pack might appear "incompatible" but it's compatible with all Minecraft versions past 1.8
